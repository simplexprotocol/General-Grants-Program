# Simplex Protocol

**Project : Simplex Protocol - DEX Pallet**

## Project Overview

**Overview**

Simplex Protocol is building a decentralized protocol on a dedicated trading chain built on polkadot. It will enable deep liquidity starting with support for the exchange of tokens on Simplex Chain, all parachains and ethereum. It then expands on this with support for additional blockchains.  

Our Decentralized EXchange (DEX) uses a dynamic bonding curve supports liquidity pools for unpegged tokens like ETH,DOT, LINK, ACA etc as well as stable coin pools offering low slippage (e.g. DAI,USDT) and moving forward stable coins with different pegs (e.g. smpUSD, smpCNY).

**Deployment**

This phase of the project will be built and deployed on a standalone chain [Simplex Protocol Auriga](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fsimplexprotocol.auriga.dev#/explorer). Subsequent Phases involve deploying as a parachain with the initial target of Rococco.

**Polkadot Ecosystem Benefits**

This protocol lays the foundation for asset exchange, stable coins and advanced aggregation. This will attract the decentralized finance community, provide more liquidity and drive adoption for polkadot.

**Why are we creating this project**

This project provides a foundational layer for the Simplex Protocol.

Our team consists of founders, researchers, builders and strategist for blockchain and decentralized finance. We have built a layer 1 blockchain at Harmony (public blockchain with sharding and open staking). We have chosen to build this project on Polkadot because Substrate allows us to focus on the Protocol and business logic and also we feel the Partners in the ecosystem are laying the foundation for interoperable decentralization and we want to be part of this community.

### Project Details

Please see [this two minute introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hkUvW5hNOU)  for an overview of the Simplex Protocol vision.

Below are the high level github repositories for the Simplex Protocol.

- Simplex Chain (based of substrate node template)
- Simplex DApp  react based frontend
- Simplex Explorer: forked from polkadot-js/apps
- Simplex js: fork of polkadot.js
- Simplex faucet-bot : faucet functionality

## Ecosystem Fit

For the DEX and bridging phase of Simplex Protocol similar projects include Acala, Polkaswap, Reef and snowfork. 
From our review of the other protocols we are the only protocol to offer multi-asset pools, optimized stable coin support, dynamic bonding curves adjustable transaction fees and limit orders.
We combine this with bridging capabilities for multi-platform support, combinatorial staking for better rewards and synthetic asset support to offer a complete soluiton.

This application is specific to the DEX Pallet and lays the foundation for the larger vision which can be seen in our [draft white paper](https://docsend.com/view/f3ts75wer8yq7ii3). 

### DEX Evolution

| Protocol | DEX | Reward Token | Multi Asset Pools | Optomized StableCoin Support | Dynamic Bonding Curves | Limit Orders | Multiple Platform Support | Dedicated Trading Chain | Synthetic Assets |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:|
| Simplex | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |
| Uniswap | YES | YES | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO |
| Balancer | YES | YES | YES | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO |
| Curve | YES | YES | YES | YES | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO |
| Acala | YES | YES | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | YES | YES |
| Reef | YES | YES | NO | NO | NO | NO | YES | TBD | NO |

The following protocols offer specific functionality and are often leaders in their respective areas.  The points below walk through a chronological evolution of DEX and cross-chain capabilities.

- Decentralized Exchanges leader Uniswap introduced a simple bonding curve supporting two token liquidity pool.
- It recently introduced itâ€™s UNI token which is now table stakes for all Decentralized EXchanges, Simplex Protocol combinatorial staking extends this combining trading, protocol and stability fees.
- Multi Asset Pools were introduced by Balancer and adopted by Curve who introduced the first bonding curve to support stable coins.
- Simplex adds to this with our dynamic bonding curves which supports multi asset pools and stable coins as well as regular tokens.
- Our Liquidity Providers can set the transaction fees when creating a Liquidity Pool similar to Balancer and Curve.
- We also introduce limit orders powered by our unique off-chain worker capabilities.
- Polkadot and Ethereum are supported initially with more platforms to come powered by our integrated bridging technology.
- Acala and Reef are also building on Polkadot which provides the ability to create dedicated trading chains.
- Maker introduced collateralized stable coins also known as synthetic assets, Acala has replicated this on Polkadot and Simplex is looking to extend this with collateralized assets using DOT, ETH and eventually Simplexâ€™s own SMP Token.

Prior to co-founding Simplex Protocol, Minh prototyped 4 projects nimspace.com, remotiveworks.com, [screentor.com](http://screentor.com) and [codelight.ai](http://codelight.ai) in 4 months. Minh was a co-founder of [Harmony](http://harmony.one) where his tasks included designing, building and deploying blockchain data structures, consensus, network deployment of 10k nodes, blockchain explorer, SDK, dapp development and a  staking dashboard. Minh worked at several startups and at Google as a technical lead. Minh came to the US to pursue his Ph.D. in Computer Science.  Minh is also a competitive programming winner and  medalists in several national programming contests (USACO Open Winner 2001).
- John Whitton : John's originally met Gavin Wood in 2016 and worked briefly with Tomasz DrwiÄ™ga on Parity before taking a role as CTO of a small Blockchain Startup based on Ethereum which then moved to Hyperledger. He did further [research](https://github.com/johnwhitton/blockchain-eval/blob/master/substrate.md) into Polkadot and Substrate in 2019 and did strategy work on smart contract protocols and digital assets in 2019 including working on Cowri,a stablecoin exchange protocol, before taking a role with Harmony as an Ecosystem Architect with a focus on Developer tooling and Ecosystem growth.

1. Implement SMP Incentivization Functionality
2. Bridging Functionality (XCMP Parachain Integration and Ethereum snowfork like integration)
3. Application Functionality (Simplex Dapp, polkadot-js apps, wallet)
4. Parachain Functionality (Launching on Roccoco initially)
5. Collateralized StableCoins Support
6. Governance model using SMP
